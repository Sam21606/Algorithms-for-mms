# Hello there these are some Algorithms for the MMS the Micro Mouse Simulator, Shoutout goes to everyone from the Team.  
## Info:  
This is a Project for my University Module in which I study the diffrences between diffrent Maze solving Algorithm.   
You can finde the MMS here https://github.com/mackorone/mms/tree/main
## Content:  
- Simple Djikstra  
- Simple A*  
    - Also a version that shows the Mice reverting Path to a Node not next to the current Node
- A* with time calculation  
    - Uses Speed, Acceleration, Decelerationn  
    - Still unfinished so results uncertain  
## Usage    
- If you want to use it in MMS theres a great guide bei mms for Python which helped me very much https://github.com/mackorone/mms-python  
- If you don't want to use Visual Studio code for your project, the mice_API Import might not work, so it will be needed to change it in any main.py
