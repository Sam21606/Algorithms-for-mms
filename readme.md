Hello there these are some Algorithms for the MMS the Micro Mouse Simulator, Shoutout goes to everyone from the Team.  
Info:  
-This is a Project for my University Module in which I study the diffrences between diffrent Maze solving Algorithm.   
Content:  
-Simple Djikstra  
-Simple A*  
-A* with time calculation  
  -Uses Speed, Acceleration, Decelerationn  
  -Still unfinished so results uncertain
